# GamePeekr

## Description
GamePeekr is a school project for Fontys ICT Made in 2023 by Danny Cornelissen. I wanted to find a solution for the fighting around game reviews. When I go online I see a lot of fights over what makes a good or bad review of videogames. However these fights hardly make sense because everyone has diffrent opinions and reviews are just that, an opinion. My Idea is this project. A social media like aproach to game reviews. I want users to be able to upload their game reviews and give people the chance to find reviewers with common opinions on what is important in their game. This way we can make reviews for a fanbase without getting rid of reviews that cater towards audiences that request a certain aspect of their videogame wich are important to the player of the game. This way there will be a place for lgbtq+, people with disabilities, diffrent etnicities and much more inclusive content. Hopefully this way people can savely find reviews that cater to their specific needs all in one place and improve their time picking out and buying new games or talking about once they have enjoyed in the past. Gaming should be for everyone.
